## Description
This code was used to process BLAST results and compute the Alien Index (AI) for the identification of candidate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events.

The scripts ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analyses presented in the thesis.

## Usage
Run the main script in the directory containing the BLAST output files:
```bash
python alienindex_batch.py
